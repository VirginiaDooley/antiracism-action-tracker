**WORK IN PROGRESS: Activism toolkit**

Take action and track your progress on issues that matter to you. 

I would like to duplicate this app in React Native to make use of push notifications. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

then 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This app uses the Google Sheets API for the backend database, built with node.js. My intention is to make entering actions as simple as possible for non-technical users.

The express server needs to run concurrently to the React apps. 
To run the server and ensure your front end has access to data: 
Open a new terminal window in the same directory and enter: 
### `node index.js`
